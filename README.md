## Introduction
Customer attrition is one of the biggest challenges of any organization, in our case it is Bank Customer attrition. Throw the Bank dataset we are going to analyze and figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, so it would help the Bank to make appropriate strategy.
The goal of our project is to create a robust classifier and use the data, where we will build a model that will recognize whether specific client will leave/unsubscribe the bank services. The project is made up of few phases:
  * Data Loading and Preprocessing
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Build Predictive Models and evaluations
  * Conlusion
